# miniproject_snakes_-_ladders
It is a game which is made using python.
This is a 2-player game.

There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the players to their chance.

The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case, it's 100).

There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as they shorten the way.

There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.

The position of snakes and ladders are not visible to players, ofcourse (but you can always have a look in the code).
